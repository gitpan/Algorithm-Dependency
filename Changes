	- Converted to Module::Install
	- Added Algorithm::Dependency::Source::HoA by request
	- Modernised the layout a little
	- Upgraded from UNIVERSAL::isa to Params::Util to support more
	  complex uses of objects like Adapaters and Decorators.

1.03 Sat Aug 21 2004
	- Because some smoke testers weren't installing Test::ClassAPI's
	  dependencies properly, add them explicitly to the Makefile.PL

1.02 Fri Aug 20 2004
	- Change missing_dependencies to use ->item and ->items rather than
	  accessing the internal directly. This means custom sub-classed
	  Sources don't have to overload ->missing_dependencies. Currently
	  in the documentation, we tell them they don't have to.

1.01 Fri Aug 20 2004
	- Fixed: ignore_orphans did not work for the ::Ordered subclass
	- Changed to test data directory to the new standard

1.0  Mon Jul 19 2004
	- Updated copyright notice
	- Updated test suite, and made it more cross-platform friendly
	- No changes needed for a long time, so incrementing to version 1.0

0.6  Wed Nov 19 2003
	- Fixed several bugs in the POD documentation
	- Updated version numbers correctly this time

0.5  Wed Nov 12 2003
	- Due to a bug I didn't notice until I had a bad Source, 
	  the missing_dependencies method just outright didn't work.
	  Bug fixed and tests added to catch the case in future.

0.4  Sat Jun 21 10:19:21 2003
	- Added the missing_dependencies method to the Source class

0.3  Sun May 11 8:13:42 2003
